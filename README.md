# Polymorphic-Malware-Analysis-Model
Presents the results of a researches on use Kohonen neural network in the analysis of polymorphic malware. The assessment of the quality training was carried out by fuzzy logic method. The datasets for training the neural network are based on the source code of the polymorphic malware abc, cheeba, december_3, stasi, otario, dm, v-sign, tequila, flip. Simulation of the Kohonen neural network operation at different iterations and visualization of the results was carried out
